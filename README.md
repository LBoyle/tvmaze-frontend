# Development Chonology

Used create-react-app to start a project. 

Import normalize and skeleton.

Using react-router-dom and history. 

Skeleton doesn't have a navbar so I'll have to make one, and responsive. 

Just two main views for now. 

Planning, examining the json data, drawing component trees.
